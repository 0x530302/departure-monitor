A distributed departure monitor using html5, angularjs and socket.io. The
monitor connects to a json formatted gtfs feed and displays departures in a
simple and responsive web interface.

This software was developed to display live departure times at ulm university,
since the local transit company does not provide a DPI (Dynamic Passenger
Information) at our university. But the SWU provides a xml feed with realtime
information for all stops and service disruption informations, which are used
for this departure monitor.
